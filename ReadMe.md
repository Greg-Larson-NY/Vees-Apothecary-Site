# Vee's Apothecary - Demo Website

Welcome to my final project for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Program. This program ran from May 5th through July 14th 2021 covering a vast array of topics from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website is a result of that instruction. 


# Introduction

I came to know of General Assembly and their class offerings after unfortunately losing my job of 25+ years in cable television during the COVID19 pandemic. As a result, I realized it was time for a change and a friend told me about a technology initiative called TechBuffalo (https://www.techbuffalo.org/) and I was given the opportunity to attend some classes through their program including UX Design. At the same time, I was taking online classes through Coursera for Social Media Marketing sponsored by Facebook and SEO Optimization by UC Davis. 

## History

This example is not the first website I had ever built but it had been over 11 years since I had built one for my previous employer. I had built several websites for the company using mostly HTML and eventually WYSIWYG editors over the years before the plug and play online editors began to take over and the switch was made to a basic WordPress site around 2016. 

For fun, and in the spirit of the old gaudy websites of the late 90's and early 2000's I decided to include an html page designed with that "feel" in mind from screenshots taken from Internet WayBack Machine (https://archive.org/web/). It can be found here: https://greg-larson-ny.github.io/Vees-Apothecary-Site/retro.html

 
## Project Scope

My project began as a way to help out a friend I met some years ago who makes many natural and skincare and hair related products in establishing a more professional web presence outside of her Etsy site she has been operating since 2017. I have worked with her in designing products in the past, designed product labels along with taking many product photos for her site so this was a natural progression. A few weeks into the project I quickly realized that the reason her business hasn't grown was more a lack of focus of on the business end rather than having help or resources so I finished the project solo as I had invested a great deal of time and thought the effort illustrated a great deal of effort, creativity and knowledge. 

## Thing I learned along the way...

That much has changed in web design over the years yet much has also remained the same. The tools have gotten more intuitive and user friendly but mobile is king now and that no matter how we may simulate for mobile there is no substitute for getting your pages live and testing on actual devices vs simulated devices and simulated browsers.  

## Where do we go from here?

I hope to continue my learning in the hopes of one day being adept enough to teach. After teaching community video production classes for over twenty five years I truly miss that aspect of work. So I hope to continue learning, work from home due to being disabled and perhaps volunteer some time along the way to those who may need some help establishing their web presence. 


## Thank You

Thank you to General Assembly, TechBuffalo, The team at GA and all the TA's at GA (past & present), the friends made during class and outside. It has been an eye opening, inspiring experience that I hope will propel me to greater heights.
